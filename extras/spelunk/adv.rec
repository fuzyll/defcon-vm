you find yourself sitting on the edge of a pool of water in
a vast chamber lit by dozens of flaring torches.

The floor is covered with thick layers of precious Persian rugs!

Rare coins, bars of silver, and lumps of gold and platinum are
strewn carelessly about!

There are diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, opals, pearls, and
fabulous sculptures and ornaments carved out of jade and imperishable
crystal resting on display shelves, along with rare Ming vases and
ancient Indian turquoise beads!

A flotilla of ruby-encrusted toy boats is floating in the pool of
water beside you!

A network of golden chains supports a fantastic Iridium crown!

There is a display case on the wall filled with a fantastic selection
of magical swords, which are singing "Hail to the Chief" in perfect
pitch and rhythm!

There are a dozen friendly little dwarves in the room, displaying
their talents by deftly juggling hundreds of golden eggs!

A large troll, a gigantic ogre, and a bearded pirate are tossing
knives, axes, and clubs back and forth in a friendly demonstration
of martial skill!

A horde of cheerful little gooseberry goblins are performing
talented acrobatics to an appreciative audience composed of a dragon,
a large green snake, a cute little bird (which is sitting, unmolested,
on the snake's head), a peaceful basilisk, and a large Arabian Djinn.

Everyone turns and sees you, and lets out a heart-warming cheer
of welcome!

roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
You're at breath-taking view.
You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is an
active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.
Across the gorge, the entrance to a valley is dimly visible.  To
the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
You're at the south end of the Valley of the Stone Faces.

flickering red light from the volcanic gorge behind you.  Carved
into the walls of the valley is an incredible series of stone faces.
Some of them look down into the valley with expressions of
benevolence that would credit a saint;  others glare with a malice
that makes the heart grow faint.  All of them are imbued with a
fantastic seeming of life by the shifting and flickering light of
the volcano.  The entire far end of the valley is taken up by an
immense carving of a seated figure;  its exact form cannot be seen
from here due to the uncertainty of the light.
You're at north end of the Valley of the Stone Faces.
You are standing at the north end of the Valley of the Stone Faces.
Above you, an incredible bas-relief statue of an immense minotaur
has been carved out of the rock.  At least sixty feet high, it sits
gazing down at you with a faint but definite expression of amusement.
Between its feet and the floor is a rock wall about ten feet high
which extends across the entire north end of the valley.
You're at south end of fog-filled room. 
You are standing at the southern end of what appears to be a
large room filled with multicolored fog.  The sides and far end
of the room cannot be seen due to the thickness of the fog - it's

written in strange, indecipherable scripts;  the only readable phrase
reads "noside samoht".  Strange shadows flit about on the walls, but
there is nothing visible to cast them.  Iridescent blue light drips
from a stalactite far above, falls towards the floor, and evaporates
before touching the ground.  A deep, resonant chanting sound vibrates
from deep in the ground beneath your feet, and a whispering sound
composed of the echoes of long-forgotten spells and cantrips seeps
from the walls and fills the air.  Passages exit to the east and west.

You are in a very small chamber.  A narrow crawl leads north.
You're in coral passage.
You are in an arched coral passage which enters from the west, splits,
and continues on to the east over a smooth and damp-looking patch of
sand.  The fork in the passage once led to the south, but it is now
completely blocked by debris.
You're at bend in arched coral corridor.
You are at a bend in an arched corral passage;  the passage enters
from the west over a patch of damp sand, turns, and continues north.
You're at fork in arched corral passage.

hall with high ribbed walls.  The hall extends far to the south;
a coral passage leads west.
You're at south end of the Jonah room.
You are at the south end of the Jonah room.  Ahead of you, the way
is barred by a large set of immense stalactites and stalagmites
which intermesh like clenched teeth.  Nothing except blackness is
visible between the stone formations.
You're in the Fourier passage.
You are in the Fourier passage.  This is a long and highly convoluted
passage composed of coral, which twists and turns like the path of
an earthworm tripping on LSD.  The passage here enters from the
northwest, convulses, and exits to the southwest (from which
direction can be felt a cool and salty-smelling breeze).
You're on shelf of rock above beach.
You are standing on a large shelf of sedementary rock overlooking
a lava beach.  The shelf is an extension of an incredible cliff
which extends north, south, and upwards for as far as the eye can
see.  Crudely carved steps lead down from the shelf to the beach, and
a twisting coral passage exits to the west.
You're on beach.
You are standing on a short, barren beach composed of hardened lava.
Rugged and unclimbable volcanic hills block all view to the north
and south, and a seemingly infinite cliff fills the entire western
hemisphere.  To the east, a narrow inlet of ocean water laps gently
upon the beach.  The scene is illuminated by the light of three small
moons shining through the shimmering glow of an aurora that fills
the entire sky with golden splendor.  Steps lead up the cliff to a
shelf of rock.
You're on tiny platform above volcano.
You are precariously perched on a tiny platform suspended in midair.
Two thousand feet below you is the mouth of a very active volcano,
spewing out a river of hot lava.

The bubbling sound ends with a loud >splash<.


A hollow, echoing >ROAR< sounds in the distance.


A strange throbbing sound can be heard in the distance.


The throbbing sound is growing louder.


The source of the throbbing sound is approaching quickly.  Another
hollow >ROAR< echoes through the cave.


There is a loud >ROAR< only a short distance away!!


Into view there bounces a horrible creature!!  Six feet across, it
resembles a large blob of translucent white jelly;  although it looks
massive, it is bouncing lightly up and down as though it were as light
as a feather.  It is emitting a constant throbbing sound, and it
>ROAR<s loudly as it sees you.

There is an immense and unfriendly-looking blob in the room with you!

The blob >ROAR<s triumphantly and bounces straight at you with amazing
speed, crushing you to the ground and cutting off your air supply
with its body.  You quickly suffocate.
A huge green fierce dragon bars the way!
The dragon is sprawled out on a Persian rug!!
Congratulations! You have just vanquished a dragon with your bare
hands!  (Unbelievable, isn't it?)
The body of a huge green dead dragon is lying off to one side.
The rotting carcass of a dead dragon is lying off to one side.
A rickety wooden bridge extends across the chasm, vanishing into the
mist.  A sign posted on the bridge reads, "STOP! Pay troll!"
The wreckage of a bridge (and a dead bear) can be seen at the bottom
of the chasm.
The charred remains of a wooden bridge can be seen at the bottom
of the chasm.
A burly troll stands by the bridge and insists you throw him a
treasure before you may cross.
The troll steps out from beneath the bridge and blocks your way.
From beneath the bridge there sounds a muffled bellow of frustrated
avarice.  The troll stomps out, resumes his position by the end of
the bridge, and glowers fiercely in your direction.  "Very funny,"
you hear him mutter, "but not very smart - you'll pay for that!"
The troll nimbly steps to one side and grins nastily as the nest of
golden eggs flies past him and plummets into the chasm.  "Fool me
once, shame on you;  fool me twice, shame on me!" he sneers.  "I want
something a touch more substantial this time!"
The troll is nowhere to be seen.
There is a large, nasty-looking ogre blocking your path!

There is a message scrawled in the dust in a flowery script, reading:
"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
The earth begins to shudder violently, and smoke flows up from the
gorge beneath your feet.  With a violent >glop<, the volcano
belches out an immense blast of molten lava which flies into the
air above the gorge and suddenly solidifies into a fragile-looking arch
of wheat-colored stone that bridges the gorge.
There is a wheat-colored stone bridge arching over the gorge.
The earth shudders violently, and steam blasts upwards from the geyser.

there are signs of melting around the edges of its door.
Resting on the throne ("sitting" isn't really the right word) is an
incredible skeleton.  It is fairly humanoid from the waist up (except
for its incredible size and four extra arms);  below that, it resembles
the body of a giant python, and is wrapped in and around the bars and
rods of the throne.  Clutched in one bony hand is a long sceptre,
ornately encrusted with sapphires!!

Vial of oily liquid
On the ground lies a small glass vial filled with an oily liquid.
The dwarf catches a lungful of the cloud, gags audibly and stumbles
out of the room retching, sneezing, and cursing up a storm.
The dwarves blanche in horror and dash away as fast as their brief
and misshapen legs can carry them.
The troll calmly waves the vapor away.

The slime filling the passage to the south blackens and shrivels
away into nothingness.
The dragon sniffs the air, rumbles deep in his chest, and shoots out
a small puff of flame that ignites and incinerates the vapor.

FINE ARABIAN PERFUME!  I HAVEN'T SMELLED ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR YEARS!"
The basilisk doesn't wake up.
The gooseberry goblins sniff the vapor, screech in terror, and dash off
into the distance.
Mushroom
There is a small mushroom growing on the wall.
There is a small mushroom lying on the floor.
As you swallow the mushroom your mouth becomes numb, and everything
seems to swirl around you.  The effect quickly passes, and you find
that your muscles have bulged unbelievably.

A strange malaise suddenly afflicts you.  You shiver with chill,
and your muscles seem to turn to putty;  everything around you becomes
grey and unreal.  The fit quickly passes, and you find that your body
has degenerated back to what it was like before you ate the mushroom.


Suddenly and without warning, there appears from within the very
cave walls around you a horde of vicious little goblins!  Each one
stands about eight inches high on a pair of spindly black legs, has
a globular, spine-covered body resembling a giant gooseberry, a
wide mouth filled with sharp teeth, and a pair of glittering little
green eyes!  They swarm around you and try to block your way.

You are surrounded by a horde of silent little gooseberry goblins!

One of the gooseberry goblins begins to giggle in a high-pitched
voice.  Another takes up the giggling, then another....  soon all
of them are giggling insanely and jumping up and down with glee!

You are surrounded by a giggling horde of little gooseberry goblins!

The goblins are jumping up and down frantically, and are working
themselves into a real slavering frenzy!!

You are surrounded by a slavering horde of gooseberry goblins!

With a shrill cry, the gooseberry goblins hurl themselves upon you,
tickling you mercilessly.  You crush and hurl away several of them,
but are soon borne down to the ground by the endless attack.  The
goblins then gleefully rip out your throat, and you sink into
unconsciousness.

Welcome to the *new* UNIX Adventure!  Say "NEWS" to get up-to-date
game details.


This is the brand-spanking-new version of UNIX Adventure.
The cave is essentially stable at this point except for bug
fixes being done as needed.  The cave is almost twice as big as
before, and has lots of new creatures in it - have fun!

Please contact the local game guru if anything weird happens (that
is, anything weird that looks like it shouldn't happen).  In
particular, if you ever see the message "Glitch!", please save
the printout for error analysis if that's possible. Credit goes
to David Platt for the design and development of this new version
of Adventure for the Xerox SIGMA-9 and other Honeywell systems.
Ken Wellsch designed and wrote the C version for running on UNIX
systems which uses the original database.

Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn
you that I look at only the first six letters of each word.
(Should you get stuck, type "HELP" for some general hints.  For infor-
mation on how to end your adventure, etc., type "INFO".)

If you have any problems, please contact the local game guru.

A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.

A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.

There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!

There are # threatening little dwarves in the room with you!
One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!
# nasty sharp knives are thrown at you!
None of them hit you!
One of them gets you!
A hollow voice says "Plugh".
There is no way to go that direction.
You have run into a wall of rock and can go no further in this
direction.
I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby objects.
I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name something
in the general direction you want to go.
I don't know how to apply that word here.
I don't understand that!
I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the
long description of your location.
It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
If you prefer, simply type W rather than WEST.
Are you trying to catch the bird?
The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch it no matter
what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.
Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
resources right now.
Do you really want to quit now?
You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
You are already carrying it!
You can't be serious!
The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
disturbed and you cannot catch it.
You might be able to catch the bird, but you could not carry it.
You aren't carrying it!
I see no # here.
The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
drives the snake away.
You have no keys!
It has no lock.
I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
It was already locked.
The grate is now locked.
The grate is now unlocked.
The lock seems to be stuck - the key refuses to turn!
It was already unlocked.
You have no source of light.
Your lamp is now on.
Your lamp is now off.
There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
probably just as well.
Nothing happens.
Where?
There is nothing here to attack.
The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
You killed a little dwarf.
You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way and stabs
you with his nasty sharp knife!
With your bare hands??
Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.

I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
like FOREST, BUILDING, DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH,
UP, or DOWN.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
particular, "INVENTORY" implies "TAKE INVENTORY", which causes me to
give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side
effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
distances with a single word.  For example, "BUILDING" usually gets
you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a
room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
Good luck!

It misses!
It gets you!
You can't unlock the keys.
You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
main passage.
I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
I need more detailed instructions to do that.
I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
things.  I cannot tell you where remote things or places are.
I don't know the word "#".
Huh??
Are you trying to get into the cave?
The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
looking elsewhere for the keys.
The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
spruce and berry bushes.
I can't see any trees around here.
Would you like instructions?
Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
progress is unlikely.
Blasting requires dynamite.
I'm as confused as you are.
Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
pit leading down to water.
Your feet are now wet.
Yeetttch!  I think I just lost my appetite.
Thank you, it was delicious!
You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly of
minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.
I'm afraid that all that's available here is salt water, which
isn't good for anything much... you'de better try elsewhere.
The bottle of water is now empty.
You convulse and fall to the ground, screaming and writhing in pain.
Rubbing the electric # is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
nothing exciting happens.
Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
That's a repulsive idea!
Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
You can't pour that.
Watch it!
Which way should I #?
Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
to try to reincarnate you?
All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
		   --- poof!! ---
You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,
you emerge from the smoke and find....
Tsk, tsk - you did it again!  Remember - you're only human, and you
don't have as many lives as a cat!  (at least, I don't think so...)
That's twice you've ended up dead - want to try for three?
As you wish.  Hang on for just a second while I fire up my thurible...
>foof!<    An immense cloud of orange smoke fills the air.  As it
clears, you find that once again....
You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long I can
keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?
Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?....  >poof!<
Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect
me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?
Yes....  well, that's the kind of blinkered, Philistine pig-ignorance
that I've come to expect from you mortals.  You sit there on your
loathsome, spotty behind, squeezing blackheads and not caring a
thinker's damn about the struggling cave-sprite, you simpering,
whining, mouldy-faced heap of parrot droppings!  If you're so
smart, then you can just reincarnate yourself, because quite
frankly I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this
anymore - I'm leaving!!!!

Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop something first.
You can't go through a locked steel grate!
I believe what you want is right here with you.
You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
There is no way across the fissure.
You're not carrying anything.
You are currently holding the following:
It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
have no bird seed.
The snake has now devoured your bird.
There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *really* mad!!
You have nothing in which to carry it.
Your bottle is already full.
There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
Your bottle is now full of water.
Your bottle is now full of oil.
You can't fill that.
Don't be ridiculous!

The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks, "Water?"
The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
although it requires some effort.
The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
You'd best take inventory and drop something.

this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
promptly snaps shut again.
You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.

Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har,"
he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
the gloom.

A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closing
soon.  All adventurers please report to the treasure room via the
alternate entrance to claim your treasure."


A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
   "This exit is closed.  Please report to the treasure room via
   the alternate entrance to claim your treasure."


It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.

The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...

Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
I don't know how to get there from here.
That's where you are now!
You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.

If you want to end your adventure early, say "QUIT".
To suspend your adventure such that you can continue later, say
"SUSPEND" (or "PAUSE" or "SAVE").  To re-start your game at a later
time, start up a new adventure and after I say "You are standing...",
you must say "RESTORE".  You can also name your game by saying
"SUSPEND mine" (and "RESTORE mine") where "mine" is the name that
you wish your suspended game to be known by (1-4 characters).
To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "HOURS".
To see how well you're doing, say "SCORE".  To get full credit for a
treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get
partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting
killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are
also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are
other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just
keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *does* happen,
it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
how much it will affect your score.  To save paper, you may specify
"BRIEF", which tells me never to repeat the full description of a
place unless you explicitly ask me to by saying "LOOK".  If you
are an experienced adventurer, you may wish to specify "FAST", which
is like "BRIEF" but more so;  in "FAST" mode I will *never* under
any circumstances give the full description of a place.  Finally, if
you are in "BRIEF" or "FAST" modes, you may return to the normal mode
of operation by saying "FULL".

Do you indeed wish to quit now?
There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
It is beyond your power to do that.
I don't know how.
It is too far up for you to reach.
You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
black smoke.
The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
The # bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
On what?
Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time
you come to it.  To get the full description, say "LOOK".
Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
The troll deftly catches the #, examines it carefully, and tosses it
back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
The troll catches the # and scurries away out of sight.
The troll refuses to let you cross.
There is no longer any way across the chasm.
Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
stumble back and fall into the chasm.
The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.
With what?  Your bare hands??  Against *his* bear hands???  Don't be
ridiculous - he'd tear you to shreds!
The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm
down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
The bear is still chained to the wall.
The chain is still locked.
The chain is now unlocked.
The chain is now locked.
There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
There is nothing here to eat.
I can give you some advice that might help you solve your problem,
but I'll have to charge you # points for it.  TANSTAAFL, y'know!
Do you want the hint?
Do you need help getting out of here?
You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.  You
could then make a map that would let you find your way around.
Are you trying to explore beyond the Plover room?
There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about
falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately
useful in discovering the secret.
Do you need help getting out of here?
Don't go west.
Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
Your lamp has run out of power.

There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't
explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call it a day.

There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've
been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"
With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for those batteries.
Your lamp is getting dim.  I'm taking the liberty of replacing the
batteries.
Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.  You'd
best start wrapping this up.
I'm afraid the magazine is written in Dwarvish.
"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest."
Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
It says, "There is something strange about this place, such that one
of the words I've always known now has a new effect."
It says the same thing it did before.
It reads, "Drop coins here to receive fresh batteries."
I'm afraid I don't understand.
It says, "Congratulations on bringing light into the Dark-room!"
You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a
myriad tiny fragments.
You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
Is this acceptable?
There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.
You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
The dome is unclimbable.
You can't get past the snake.
You have crawled around in a little passage north of and parallel
to the Hall of Mists.
Aaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeee........               >splat<
Hmmmm - I never saw a red flapjack before!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh........        >squish<
Yetch - what a mess!
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh............         >crunch<
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllllpppppp...........      >smash<
There's nothing climbable here.
What do you want me to do with the #?
The crack is far too small for you to enter.
The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.
It would be advisable to leave via the exit.
You have no #!
There's nothing to climb here.  Say "UP" or "OUT" to leave the pit.
You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
You scurry up the plant and into the hole in the wall.
As you approach the bear, it snarls threateningly;  you are forced
to retreat without the #.
You can't get by the dragon to get at the rug.


You have scored a total of # points, out of a possible maximum of
# points.  During this game of Adventure, you have taken a total of
# turns.


There is nowhere for me to jump to.
I'm not sure what you want me to # - please be more specific.
The dwarf quickly scuttles off into the gloom.
Ok - "#".
If you were to quit now, you would score a total of # points, out
of a possible maximum of # points.
You are obviously a rank amateur.  Better luck next time.
Your score qualifies you as a novice-class adventurer.
You have achieved the rating; "Experienced Adventurer".
You may now consider yourself a "Seasoned Adventurer".
You have reached "Junior Master" status.
Your score puts you in Master Adventurer class C.
Your score puts you in Master Adventurer class B.
Your score puts you in Master Adventurer class A.
All of Adventuredom gives tribute to you, Adventurer Grandmaster!
You only need one more point to reach the next level of expertise!
To reach the next qualification level you need # more points.
The old batteries in your lamp were pretty well shot - I've taken the
the liberty of putting in the new ones.
I don't know how to # such a thing.
I can save your Adventure for you, but if I do you'll have to wait
at least # minutes before continuing.
I'm sorry, but I can't save your game at the moment;  something
seems to be wrong with the save file.
I can't find any saved game for you to restore.
An explosion has destroyed the well-house during the time that your
game was suspended.  You're going to have to start over.
Do you want me to keep the save-image?
Do you wish to continue with the game immediately?
I'm sorry - only a wizard can restart a game in less than # minutes.
The # flies through the air and thoroughly drenches the dwarf.  He
shakes himself off and curses violently; he *REALLY* looks angry!
The # flies through the air and thoroughly drenches the dwarves. They
shake themselves off and curse violently; they *REALLY* look angry!
There is nothing here that I can drink!
There's nothing written on the oyster.
There is nothing written on the top of the oyster.
I'm terrible sorry - Colossal Cave is closed.  Our hours are:

I'm afraid that I can't start up a real Adventure for you at the
moment; the system's ETMF is too high.
I'm afraid that there are too many people on the system at the moment;
I can't start up a real Adventure for you.
We do allow visitors to make short explorations during our off hours.

Would you like to do that?
Ok, then - I suggest that you try again later.

A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you.  It clears away
to reveal a tall wizard, clothed in grey.  He fixes you with a steely
glare and declares, "This adventure has lasted too long."  With that
he makes a single pass over you with his hands, and everything around
you fades away into a grey nothingness.
I'm afraid that I can't restore your saved game - it's prime time
at the moment, and only demonstration Adventures are permitted.
I'm sorry, but I can't restore your Adventure - the ETMF is too
high.  You'll have to try again later.
I'm sorry, but there are too many users on the system at the moment;
please try again later when the system is less heavily in use, and
I'll restore your Adventure then.

Colossal Cave is open during the following hours:

Are you actually a wizard?
Prove it - say the magic word!
Oh, pooh - you are nothing but a charlatan!  That little piece of
deception is going to cost you 10 points!!
Oh, dear, you really *are* a wizard!  Sorry to have bothered you....
Nothing obvious happens.
Hmmmm..  This sand is rather soft, and you're sinking in a little...
In fact you're sinking in a lot!   Oh, no - it's QUICKSAND!!  HELP!!
HELP!!! HELP!! >glub<   >glub<    >glub<     >blurp<  
You know, I've heard of people who really fell in for the soft sell,
but  >glub<  this  >glub<  is  >glub<  ridiculous!         >blop!<
As you enter into the passage, you are forced to brush up against
some of the green slime.  Instantly it flows down and covers your
body, and rapidly digests away all of your flesh.
With a sharp sizzling sound, a large spark of electricity jumps
out of thin air and strikes your lamp.  The immense electrical charge
flows to ground through your body and fries you to a crisp.
With a loud "zap" a bolt of lightning springs out of midair and strikes
your lamp, which immediately and violently explodes.  You narrowly
miss being torn to shreds by the flying metal.

In a loud crackle of electricity, a bolt of lightning jumps out of
nowhere and strikes your lamp.  The lamp instantly explodes like a
grenade, and you are mown down by a cloud of shrapnel.
The air fills with tension, and there is a subdued crackling sound.
A blue aura forms about your lantern, and small sparks jump from the
lantern to the ground.  The aura fades away after several seconds,
and your lamp is once again shining brightly.
The singing sword slides easily out of the rock.
The sword is firmly embedded in the stone, and you aren't strong
enough to pull it out.
The vial strikes the ground and explodes with a violent >foom<,
neatly severing your foot.  You bleed to death quickly and messily.
The vial explodes into splinters and disintegrates, releasing an
oily liquid which rapidly sublimes into a large mushroom-shaped cloud
of pale puce vapor smelling like sequoia sap and ozone.
of bright green vapor smelling like pine needles and sea water.
of thick yellow vapor smelling like cheddar cheese and bananas.
of choking green vapor smelling like chlorine and apples.
of misty white vapor with no scent.
of nearly-invisible vapor with a strong odor of walnuts and onions.
of ominously glowing vapor smelling of hot iron.
As you reach the middle of the bridge, the troll appears from out
of the tunnel behind you, wearing a large backpack.  "So, Mister
Magician," he shouts, "you like to use magic to steal back my hard-
earned toll?  Let's see how you like a little of MY magic!!"  With
that, he aims a tube running from the backpack directly at the bear
and pulls a trigger.  A spout of magical fire roars out and singes the
bear's fur;  the bear bellows in pain and dashes onto the bridge to
escape.  The bridge shudders, groans, and collapses under the weight,
and you and the bear plunge down into the chasm.

that, he aims a tube running from the backpack directly at the bridge
and pulls a trigger.  A spout of magical fire roars out and incinerates
the bridge supports, causing the bridge to sway giddily and collapse
into the chasm.  You plunge down to your death.
The sword misses the bear, bounces off of the wall, and lands at
your feet.
The bear dodges away from your attack, growls, and swipes at you
with his claws.  Fortunately, he misses.
The bear snarls, ducks away from your attack and slashes you to death
with his claws.

>>Foof!<<

Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.......     >oof<

The icy slide is far too steep and slippery to climb.
The ogre growls at you and refuses to let you pass.
The ogre contemptously catches the # in mid-swing, rips it out
of your hands, and uses it to chop off your head.
The ogre casually catches the # in mid-air, braces his feet, winds
up and throws the # straight back at you with incredible force.  You
are unable to dodge it and it chops you in half.
The sword halts in mid-air, twirls like a dervish, and chants several
bars of "Dies Ire" in a rough tenor voice.  It then begins to spin
like a rip-saw blade and flies directly at the ogre, who attempts to
catch it without success;  it strikes him full on the chest.  There is
a brilliant flash of light, a deafening roar and a cloud of oily grey
smoke;  when the smoke clears (and your eyes begin working properly
again) you see that the ogre has vanished.  The sword is lying on the
ground, sparking and flaming.  Before your eyes it softens and melts,
writhes as if in pain, and shrinks rapidly until all that is left is
a small silvery ring which cools rapidly.
You attack the ogre, but he fends off your attack easily and comes
very close to crushing your skull with *his* bare (but extremely
strong) hands.  You are forced to retreat in disgrace.
You attack the ogre - a brave but foolish action.  He quickly grabs
you and with a heave of his mighty arms rips your body limb from limb.
I'm afraid I can't go that way - walking on red-hot lava is contrary
to union regulations (and is bad for your health anyhow).
That archway looks pretty fragile - you'd better leave the bear here.
As you approach the center of the archway, hot vapors saturated with
brimstone drift up from the lava in the gorge beneath your feet.  You
are swiftly overcome by the foul gasses and, with your lungs burned
out, fall off of the bridge and into the gorge.
As you approach the center of the archway, hot vapors saturated with
brimstone drift up from the lava in the gorge beneath your feet.  The
mithril ring in your hand quivers and glows, and the fumes eddy away
from the bridge without harming you.

As you reach the center of the bridge, a ghostly figure appears in
front of you.  He (?) stands at least eight feet tall, and has the
lower body of an enormous snake, six arms, and an angry expression on
his face.  "You'll not have my sceptre that easily!" he cries, and
makes a complex magical gesture with his lower right arm.  There is a
brilliant flash of light and a vicious >crack<, and the bridge cracks
and plummets into the gorge.
The door to the safe has no keyhole, dial, or handle - I can't figure
out how to open it!
The # is already open!
The door to the safe seems to be fused shut - I can't open it.
The # is already closed!
>Creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek<     >ker-CHUNK!<

The safe is now closed.
>ker-THUNK<
            >screeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeech<

The (somewhat rusty) safe is now open.
You pluck the sceptre from the skeleton's bony hand.  As you do, the
skeleton raises its head and whispers "Remember - #!" in a
forboding tone; it then sags to the ground and crumbles into dust which
drifts away into the still air of the cave.
As you pluck the sceptre from the skeleton's grasp, it raises its head
and whispers, "You blew it!".  It then shivers and collapses into a
pile of fine dust which quickly vanishes.

>bong<                 The very air quivers with sound as though
   >bong<               someone, somewhere in the distance, has struck
      >bong<             three powerful blows on an immense brass gong.

Smoke trickles out from around the edges of the safe's door, and the
door itself glows red with heat for a moment.

A hollow voice says,  "This is a Class 1 security alarm.  All cave
security forces go to Orange Alert.  I repeat - Orange Alert."

The safe's door is blocking the exit passage - you'll have to close
the safe to get out of here.
EEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh..........

                                                      >sizzle<
The # cuts through the blob's body (?) without harming it.
You attack the strange blob, but bounce harmlessly off of its strong
but very rubbery skin.
Rock silently crumbles off of the wall in front of you, revealing
dark passages leading northwest, north, and northeast.
Having problems?
Ok - what you need to do is apply a little philosophy.  To wit:  there
is a question that you need to ask whenever you explore a new room
in this cave.  In most places, the answer to the question is "yes".
In some other places, it's "no" for an obvious reason.  Right here,
the answer is "no" but the reason isn't so obvious.  If you can figure
out what the question is, you can get out of here easily.  I can tell
you this - it's always a vital question if you wish to survive.
The basilisk stirs restlessly and grumbles in its sleep as you pass,
but it does not awaken.

The basilisk stirs grumpily and awakens, peering sleepily about.  It
sees its reflection in the metal plate that you are carrying,
shudders, and turns into solid granite.

The basilisk stirs grumpily and awakens, peering sleepily about.  It
spies you, growls, and stares you straight in the eye.  Your body
is instantly petrified.
You attack the basilisk mightily.  It instantly awakens and looks you
dead in the eye, and your body turns to solid rock.
The # rebounds harmlessly from the basilisk's tough scales.  The
basilisk awakens, grunting in shock, and glares at you.  You are
instantly turned into a solid rock statue (and not a particularly
impressive one, at that).
The # rebounds harmlessly from the pentagram's magic force
field.  It's just as well - the djinn doesn't seem dangerous.
You kill several of the gooseberry goblins with your #, but
the others swarm at you, force you to the ground, and rip out
your throat.
That's not a wise thing to try - djinni are essentially immortal
and thus are pretty hard to hurt.  Besides, this one seems rather
friendly - why don't you just try releasing him?
Goblins live exclusively on human flesh, and you can't spare
any of your own to placate them.  On the other hand, I suspect
that they're going to eat you pretty soon whether you like it
or not - you'd better find some way of killing them or driving
them away!

As each of the dragon's teeth strikes the ground, a fully-armed human
skeleton springs up from where it struck and leaps to your defense!
The skeletal warriors attack the vicious gooseberry goblins and drive
them away in screaming panic;  they then salute you with their ancient
and rusty swords, and fade silently into nothingness.

The wax seal breaks away easily.  A cloud of dark smoke pours up from
the mouth of the flask and condenses into the form of a twelve-foot
Djinn standing in the pentagram.  He pushes experimentally at the
magical wall of the pentagram (which holds), and nods politely to
you.  "MY THANKS, OH MORTAL," he says in an incredibly deep bass
voice.  "IT HAS BEEN THREE THOUSAND YEARS SINCE SOLOMON SEALED ME
INTO THAT BOTTLE, AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAVE RELEASED ME.  IF
YOU WILL OPEN THIS PENTAGRAM AND LET ME GO FREE, I WILL GIVE YOU SOME
ADVICE THAT YOU MAY ONE DAY WISH TO POSSESS."
The flask's wax seal crumbles at your touch.  A large cloud of black
smoke pours out, solidifying into the form of a twelve-foot Djinn.
"AT LAST!" he says in an earth-shaking voice, "I KNEW THAT SOMEDAY
SOMEONE WOULD RELEASE ME!  I WOULD REWARD YOU FOR THIS, MORTAL, BUT
IT HAS BEEN THREE THOUSAND YEARS SINCE I HAD A SOLID MEAL, AND I'M
NOT GOING TO STAND HERE CHATTERING WHEN I COULD BE OUT EATING A SIX-
INCH SIRLOIN STEAK.  FAREWELL."  With that, he somewhat rudely explodes
back into smoke and drifts quickly out of sight.
The pentagram's magical barrier sparks fitfully and goes down.  The
Djinn stretches gratefully and smiles at you.  "AGAIN, MY THANKS," he
says.  "MY ADVICE TO YOU WILL TAKE THE FORM OF A HISTORY LESSON.
WHEN RALPH WITT, THE ARCHITECT AND CONSTRUCTOR OF THIS CAVE, WAS VERY
YOUNG, HE BECAME VERY INCENSED THAT HIS NAME WAS AT THE END OF THE
ALPHABET.  HE FELT (FOR SOME REASON) THAT THE LETTER W BELONGED NEAR
THE BEGINNING OF THE ALPHABET, AND THAT ALL OF THOSE "UPSTART LETTERS
WHICH UNFAIRLY USURPED THE BEST PLACES" SHOULD BE FORCED INTO EXILE
AT THE END OF THE ALPHABET.  HIS INSTINCT FOR MATTERS MAGICAL AND
MYSTICAL LED HIM TO APPLY THIS STRANGE BELIEF INTO THE CAVE'S
STRUCTURE WHEN HE EXCAVATED IT.  YOU HAVEN'T YET BEEN AFFECTED BY HIS
STRANGE HABITS, BUT YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THIS.  FAREWELL, AND GOOD
LUCK."  With that, the Djinn evaporates into a cloud of smoke and
drifts rapidly away.
You attack the goblins and manage to squash a few, but the others
overwhelm you, forcing you to the ground and ripping out your throat.
The pentagram is empty - there's nothing to let out!
You are being pursued by a vicious horde of little gooseberry goblins!

You have jumped into a bottomless pit.  You continue to fall for
a very long time.  First, your lamp runs out of power and goes
dead. Later, you die of hunger and thirst.
You have jumped into a bottomless pit.  Eventually, you die of thirst.
The safe's door is closed, and you can't get in!
There is no handle on the inside of the safe door, nor any other way
to get a grip on it.  You'll have to leave the safe before shutting it.
I can't swim, or walk on water.  You'll have to find some other way
to get across, or get someone to assist you.
You step gently on Darwin the Tortoise's back, and he carries you
smoothly over to the southern side of the reservoir.  He then blows
a couple of bubbles at you and sinks back out of sight.


>BONNNNGGGGGGGGGG<

Darwin the Tortoise blinks in surprise at the noise, but does nothing.

>BONNNNNGGGGGGGGG<

A hollow voice says, "The GallopingGhost Tortoise Express is now at
your service!"

With a swoosh and a swirl of water, a large tortoise rises to the
surface of the reservoir and paddles over to the shore near you.
The message, "I'm Darwin - ride me!" is inscribed on his back in
ornate letters.

Into the whirlpool??
You plunge into the water and are sucked down by the whirlpool.
You plunge into the water and are sucked down by the whirlpool.  The
current is incredibly strong, and you barely manage to hold onto
your lamp;  everything else is pulled from your grasp and is lost in
the swirling waters.
You plunge into the water and are sucked down by the whirlpool into
pitch darkness.
You plunge into the water and are sucked down by the whirlpool into
pitch darkness.  The current is incredibly strong, and everything that
you are carrying is ripped from your grasp and is lost in the swirling
waters.

The swirling waters deposit you, not ungently, on solid ground.


A large phosphorescent cloud of smoke drifts into view, and a large
mouth and two dark eyes take shape on the side.  One of the eyes winks
at you, and the djinn's deep voice says "GREETINGS AGAIN, MORTAL.  I
HAVE REMEMBERED A PIECE OF ANCIENT LORE THAT I LEARNED FROM MY AUNT,
AN AFREET OF GREAT KNOWLEDGE.  THERE IS ANOTHER MAGIC WORD THAT YOU
MIGHT FIND OF USE IF YOU SHOULD EVER FIND YOURSELF BEING ATTACKED BY
THOSE PESTIFEROUS DWARVES.  YOU SHOULD USE IT ONLY AS A LAST RESORT,
THOUGH, SINCE IT IS A MOST POTENT WORD AND IS PRONE TO BACKFIRE FOR
NO OBVIOUS REASON;  ALSO, IT SHOULD NEVER BE USED NEAR WATER OR NEAR
ANY SHARP WEAPON OR THE RESULTS MAY BE MOST UNFORTUNATE.  THE WORD
IS 'phuggg'", whispers the djinn, "AND IT MUST BE PRONOUNCED CAREFULLY
IF IT IS TO HAVE THE PROPER EFFECT.  FAREWELL AGAIN, AND GOOD LUCK!"
With that, the djinn-cloud drifts away out of sight.


>splurch!<

Oh, no!  You've turned yourself into a jellyfish, and fallen to the
ground and been splattered far and wide!  Well, that certainly wasn't
very smart!!!  You were warned not to use that work near water!

The ground begins to shudder ominously, and the very cave walls around
you begin to creak and groan!  A sulphurious stench fills the air!

With an incredible lurch, the ground begins to dance and ripple as
though it were liquid!  You are thrown off of your feet and tossed
violently up and down!  The cave walls begin to crumble and split from
the stress!

There is a terrible ROAR of rending rock!!  The cave ceiling splits,
and rocks plunge down and smash your lower body to a gooey paste!!

There is a violent blast in the distance!  Steam and smoke drift into
view through the rents in the walls, and furiously-bubbling red-hot
lava flows in and surrounds you.  The cave ceiling disintegrates in
an incredible orgy of grinding destruction, and the cave walls fall
and are pounded into fine dust.



You are lying, badly mangled, on a small rock island in a sea of
molten lava.  Above you, the sky is faintly visible through a thick
pall of smoke and steam.  A short distance to the north, the remains
of a well-house are sinking slowly into the bubbling ooze.


There is a distant, sourceless screech of incredible anguish!  With
a sharp >poof< and a small puff of orange smoke, a bent and bearded
elf appears.  He is dressed in working clothes, and has a name-tag
marked "Ralph" on his shirt.  "You blithering idiot!" he storms.
"You were warned quite clearly not to use that work near water!!  I
hadn't gotten all of the bugs out of it yet, and now your incredible
incompetance has totally destroyed Colossal Cave!!  Do you have the
faintest scintilla of an iota of an understanding of how much work
I'm going to have to do to get the cave rebuilt?!?  I'll have to go
all the way to Peking for another dragon, and I'll have to convince
the Goblin's Union to send me another team of gooseberry goblins;
I'll have to sub-contract the building of the volcano out to the
local totrugs, and worst of all I'll have to go through eight months
of paperwork and red tape to file a new Environmental Impact
statement!!  All because you couldn't follow directions, you
purblind and meatbrained moron!  I'm rescinding all of your game
points and throwing you out!  Out!   OUT!   GET OUT!$!%#&'@%!!%%!"

Your axe glows bright orange and fades into nothingness.
Your sword jumps into the air, chants several bars of the "Volga
Boatman", shoots off several fitful blue sparks, and disintegrates.
A clear, liquid chime sounds in midair.  A large, four-clawed hand
reaches out of the ground, grabs the dwarf, and pulls it down into
nothingness.
A clear, liquid chime sounds in midair.  A long green tentacle
covered with sucker disks reaches out from nowhere, grabs the
dwarves, and pulls them back to wherever it came from.
There is a sharp sizzling sound.  The dwarf explodes into flame
and vanishes.
There is a sharp sizzling sound.  The dwarves are engulfed in
a wave of fire that appears from nowhere, and are completely
incinerated;  the flames then vanish into nothingness again.
There is a sharp whistling sound from nowhere.  The dwarf shudders
and turns into a moth, which then flies away.
There is a sharp whistling sound from nowhere.  The dwarves stiffen,
shudder, and melt down into a large puddle of soggy goo that quickly
soaks into the ground and vanishes.
A clear, liquid chime sounds in midair.  A large, four-clawed foot
appears in midair and stomps violently downward, missing the dwarf
but thoroughly squashing you.
A clear, liquid chime sounds in midair.  A large and very toothy
mouth appears in midair and chomps ferociously.  The dwarves manage
to evade it, but it bites you in half.
There is a sharp sizzling sound.  A ball of fire roars out of nowhere,
misses the dwarf, bounces off of a wall, and incinerates you.
There is a sharp sizzling sound.  A ball of fire appears from nowhere,
bounces off of the ground, and explodes violently, incinerating both
you and the dwarves.
There is a sharp crackling sound from the air above you.  The dwarf
shudders and turns into a sabre-toothed tiger, which attacks and
kills you in short order.
There is a sharp crackling sound from the air above you.  The dwarves
stiffen, fall to the ground, and melt into a large puddle of soggy
goo.  The goo twitches a few times and then flows at you with
incredible speed;  it attacks and strangles you with little
difficulty.
You have set the flask down in the center of the pentagram.
From somewhere in the distance, there comes a musical skirl of
light, elvish laughter and the sounds of merriment.
From somewhere nearby, there suddenly comes a sound of something
mechanical in motion.  As you turn towards it, an incredible
figure rolls into the light of your lamp.  It stands about five
feet high on a wheeled metal pedestal, and has a globular light-
filled head, accordion-pleated metal arms, and a cylindrical body
the size of an oil drum with a plastic panel on the front.  It rolls
past without taking any notice of you, all the while waving its
arms, flashing a light behind its front panel and bellowing "WARNING!
WARNING!  DANGER!" at the top of its not inconsiderable voice.  It
rolls on out of sight, and moments later there is an immense flash
of light and a tremendous blast of sparks and smoke.  When the air
clears, you find that no trace remains of the strange apparition.
With a sudden gust of air, a large cave bat flutters into view,
flies around your head several times, squeaks with disgust, and
flutters on out of sight.
Suddenly, the ground quivers underfoot;  a dull rumbling sound
resounds from the rock around you, and in the distance you can
hear the crash of falling rock.  The earth tremor subsides after
a few seconds without causing any major damage.
From the darkness nearby comes the sound of shuffling feet.  As you
turn towards the sound, a nine-foot cyclops ambles into the light of
your lamp.  The cyclops is dressed in a three-piece suit of worsted
wool, and is wearing a black silk top-hat and cowboy boots and is
carrying an ebony walking-stick.  It catches sight of you and stops,
seeming frozen in its tracks, with its bloodshot eye bulging in
amazement and its fang-filled jaw drooping with shock.  After staring
at you in incredulous disbelief for a few moments, it reaches into
the pocket of its vest and pulls out a small plastic bag filled with
a leafy green substance, and examines it carefully.  "It must be
worth eighty pazools an ounce after all" mumbles the cyclops, who
casts one final look at you, shudders, and staggers away out of
sight.
From somewhere in the distance comes a heart-wrenching scream of
mortal terror!  "NO!  DON'T!  NO!  NO!  HELP!!!!" cries the voice,
and then lets out a wail of agony that is cut off abruptly.  Subdued
crunching and slurping sounds can be heard for a minute or so, and
then silence falls.
From somewhere nearby come the sounds of sliding, stumbling feet.
As you turn towards them, the beam of your lamp falls upon a tall,
shambling figure approaching you out of the darkness.  Standing no
more than five feet tall, it cannot possibly weigh more than fifty
pounds including the shroud and bandages in which it is wrapped;
a musty reek like the scent of old, dead earth seeps from it and
fills the air.  As you cower back in disgust and horror, the figure
halts, examines you through eyes resembling wet pebbles, and
whispers "Peace, man!" in a voice like wind rustling through dead
trees.  It then turns and shambles away into the darkness.
You have tossed the # down into the pit.
You have thrown the # down into the fissure.
You have tossed the # down into the hole in the floor.
You have tossed the # down into the room below you.
You have tossed the # down into the canyon beneath your feet.
You have hurled the # into the middle of the whirlpool.
You have thrown the # down into the mist filling the cavern.
You have hurled the # down into the misty bottom of the chasm.
You have hurled the # down into the boiling lava at the bottom
of the volcanic gorge.
You have tossed the # down the chimney.
You have tossed the # down into the lava tube and out of sight.
You have thrown the # down the steps and out of view.
You have tossed the # down the icy slide and out of sight.
You have thrown the # down onto the beach.
You have negligently tossed the # into the center of the reservoir.
A delicate crash sounds from below.
Are you having problems getting out of the ice tunnels?
To get out of here, you'll first have to get your bearings so that
you know where you are.  I suggest that you draw a careful, accurate
map of the tunnel system;  for clarity's sake, keep your lines as
straight as is feasible and draw in all of the dead ends and such.
Once you've got a complete and accurate map, examine it carefully; if
your thoughts refuse to clarify, you might try using the old Yoga
trick of standing on your head, and see if that helps.
It's pitch dark in here - I can't tell whether there's anything here
that I can pick up!
Hmmph - you're not asking for much, are you - it's pitch dark in
here!  Well, I'll grope around and try to find the #.....


You stumbled into a pit and broke your back!
Hmmph - you're not asking for much, are you - it's pitch dark
in here, and I'll have to grope around to try to find the #.
Well, if I must, I must......   {hunt}   {search}    {hunt}



No luck - I can't find the #!.  Get me some light and maybe I'll
be able to do better!
Hmmph - you're not asking for much, are you - it's pitch dark in
here, and I'll have to grope around to find the #.  Oh,
well, I suppose that that's part of my job...    {hunt}  {search}

    {trip}   {curse}   {catch self}   {nurse scraped hand}  {seek}

Aha!    I have located the #!.
It says, "** w00t you have found a ctf flag **"
The paper vanishes in a puff of smoke
That tasted like crap.  Why the hell would you eat paper?  really!?
PAPER WAS IN LIMBO!
